## 🚀 Nextcloud Setup

Follow these steps to get **Nextcloud** up and running with Docker Compose.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** - Required to run Nextcloud inside a container.
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)** - For orchestrating multi-container Docker applications.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravichanderjha/docker-compose.git
   cd docker-compose
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Compose command** to start Nextcloud in detached mode (background):
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-nextcloud.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Access Nextcloud**: 
   Once the containers are up and running, open your browser and visit `http://localhost` to start using Nextcloud.

### 🛠 Configuration

You can customize the `docker-compose-nextcloud.yml` file based on your preferences, such as changing the volumes, ports, and environment variables.

### 🧰 File Structure
